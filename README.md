This project is still under development.

Multithreaded Monte Carlo Simulation Engine, designed primarily for coding theory, communications theory

This project was started in 2009 when I was a PhD student at Iowa State University and the most development was done in 2010. I decided to revisit it in 2013. I am planning a rework on the build system and make it open source.

This project has been used for my research and resulted in one conference paper and one journal paper. 

Usually students in coding theory do not write C++ codes. C/Matlab is enough. This project is an attempt to use modern C++ and object-oriented design ideas in writting a simulation engine for coding theory research.
