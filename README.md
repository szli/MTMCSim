This project was started in 2009 when I was a PhD student at Iowa State University and the most development was done in 2010.  This project has been used for my research and resulted in one conference paper and one journal paper. Usually grad students in coding theory do not write C++ since C/Matlab is enough. The motivation of this project is to use modern C++ and object-oriented design ideas in writting simulations for coding theory research.

I revisit it in 2013, use CMake as the build system and make it open source. I will try to make improvements to this project if time permits. The limitations/to-do items are in the issues page of github.

Some examples of currently developed simulations are available in the simulations directory. It is not complete and I will keep adding it.
